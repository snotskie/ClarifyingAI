# Grounding AI: Beliefs, Ethics, and Social Change

## Principal Investigator

Alan Rubel, University of Wisconsin-Madison 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to explore beliefs, narratives, and practices pertaining to (a) artificial intelligence, (b) ethics, ethical practices, and moral reasoning, (c) social change, and (d) cross-domain collaboration; as held by (e) those who create, train, deploy, use, interpret, and regulate artificial intelligence, as well as those who teach these facets in higher education.

## Participants

Participants are selected who:

- have been a faculty member at a US university where AI Ethics Course(s) may be taught to undergraduate students, and may teach or have taught such courses
- or are or have been an employee of a US company where AI is created, trained, deployed, used, interpreted, or regulated, and you may have insight into how such work engages with AI in ethical ways

## Activities

This study will be conducted remotely using Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

Activities include:

- Initial interview (90 minutes)
- One or two optional follow-up interviews (30 minutes each)

Interviews will involve discussing participants':

- professional experiences teaching or working with AI
- objectives, motivations, practices, and concerns around AI
- personal experiences that shape where they stand today regarding AI

Interviews will only be recorded if automatic transcript quality is poor, and all recordings will be deleted once transcripts have been hand-corrected and reviewed.

We will quote participants directly without using their name or other identifiable information, such as the names of their location or employer. Participants may choose not to be quoted directly. 

## Benefits

While there are no direct benefits to participants for participating in this study, their participation may indirectly benefit others by helping us identify themes as the basis for further research.

## Risks

There are a number of minimal risks involved in any interview-based study:

- Participants may reveal sensitive information.
- There is a risk of a confidentiality breach.
- If participants' responses were revealed it could affect their employment or reputation.

Every effort will be made to protect participants' confidentiality:

- Interviews will take place in private video interviews using Microsoft Teams or Zoom.
- No audio will be published.
- The recordings will be heard only by the Principal Investigators, Project Assistants, and transcription professionals.
- All audio recordings will be kept in a secure campus server which can only be accessed by the research team.
- Recordings will be deleted as soon as they have been transcribed.
- Unrelated sensitive information and personally identifiable information will be removed from the transcripts.
- All names in the transcripts will be changed to pseudonyms.
- Data will be used for academic purposes only.

Also note:

- If using a teleconferencing software, we cannot guarantee confidentiality with respect to that software in the event of, for example, a data breach at Microsoft or Zoom.
- Deidentified transcripts may be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies, without additional informed consent.
